A utility written in powershell to replace the cached wallpaper file on windows. Very useful on systems where the wallpaper is set using group policy and can not be changed.

## How does it work?
It replaces the cached wallpaper. Due to it replacing the file and not actually changing the wallpaper from settings, it will not show up in the settings app. It also does not require administrator privledges to run, meaning that it is very useful on managed systems such as a work or school laptop.
